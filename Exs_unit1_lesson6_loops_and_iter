#Ex: 1.	Make a program that generates a list that has all squared values of integers from 1 to 100, i.e., 
#like this: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, …, 10000]
li = list(range(1, 1001))

for x in li:
  for i in li:
    if x / i == i:
      new_l.append(x)
    else:
      continue
print(new_l)

#Ex.2:Make a program that prompts the user to input the name of a car, 
#the program should save the input in a list and ask for another, and then another, until the user inputs ‘q’, 
#then the program should stop and the list of cars that was produced should be printed.
car_li = []

while con ==0 :
  x = str(input("Please input the name of a car or press 'q' to quit: "))
  if x == 'q':
    break
  elif x!= 'q':
    car_li.append(x)
print(car_li)

#Ex.3:Start of with any list containing at least 10 elements, then print all elements in reverse order.
li = list(range(1, 11))
li.reverse()
